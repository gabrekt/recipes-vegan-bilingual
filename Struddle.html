    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>125 g / 1 cup all purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>25 g / 2 tbsp neutral tasting oil (I used coconut oil (melted), plus more to grease.</li>
        <li>approx. 60 ml / ¼ cup warm water.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>15 g / 1 tbsp neutral tasting oil (I used coconut oil (melted).</li>
        <li>30 g / 3 tbsp breadcrumbs, toasted on a dry pan.</li>
        <li>800 g / 28 oz apples (I recommend sour apples, like Bramley).</li>
        <li>approx. 100 g / ½ cup sugar* (coconut sugar for refined sugar free version).</li>
        <li>1-1½ tsp ground cinnamon, adjust to taste.</li>
        <li>30 g / ¼ cup raisins, soaked in boiling water for 10 min (optional).</li>
        <li>icing sugar, to decorate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Preparation Dough</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and salt together in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add oil and warm water and mix together with a fork until scraggly dough forms.</li>
        <li>Empty the dough onto the work surface and knead for about 10 minutes alternating between kneading the dough and throwing the dough ball against the work bench as if you wanted to bounce it off. By the time you’ve finished the dough should be elastic and silky smooth.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball, grease it lightly and place it on plate. Cover it with an upside down bowl rinsed with hot boiling water. Rest the dough for about 30 minutes and move onto the filling (see below).</li>
        <li>Just before you are ready to roll out the dough, preheat the oven to 200° C / 390° F. Line a large baking tray with a piece of baking paper.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested and the filling is ready, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Decide where your filling is going to go, taking into account the size of your baking tray. Designate the area for the filling leaving a wide margin alongside the filling so that you could cover the filling with it and a smaller margin at both ends. Pile the filling in the designated area making sure that it is compact and even.</li>
        <li>Start folding the pastry over the filling like you would fold a burrito. Fold the sides over the filling first and then the bottom flap of pastry – see photo above.</li>
        <li>Using the kitchen towel underneath – roll the strudel so that it gets wrapped up in the rest of the pastry as it rolls – see photo above.</li>
        <li>Using your kitchen towel, transfer the log gently to the prepared baking tray. Brush the strudel with oil.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 45 minutes – until golden. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with icing sugar and allow it to cool off a little before cutting.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Preparation Filling</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and core your apples and slice them paper thin using a sharp knife or a mandolin.</li>
        <li>Just before filling the strudel, mix in sugar, cinnamon and well drained raisins. Mix well and fill the strudel.</li>
    </ol>
